# badbank-app

I have created this project App to demonstrate how to tie the Front-End using React.js with the Back-End using mongoDB along with express.js.
This is a Bank App that demonstrates how to add users and add or withdraw money from their account. I use the term Bad Bank due to the lack of data security!
So, now the next step is to make it a "Good" Bank!   ...loading

For you to run this App you can easy download these files either in .zip format or by cloning my repository to your computer.
  -(in Terminal just type "git clone https://hithub...."). 
  -Then simply install all dependencies("run in terminal 'npm install' "). You will need node.js installed to your computer.
  -Then in your terminal again type ("node index.js") and the at your browser navigate to the localhost your app is running(here is "3000")
  
  
I used 
  1.React.js as the main framework,
  2.mongoDB as my database,
  3.node.js is my runtime environment,
  4.express.js to manage the routes
